# A Short Hike Modding Tools

In order to play with mods, you first need to download the 'ModdingTools.zip' from the [Releases]() page, and then extract it into the game's root directory.

For steam, that will be ```C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\A Short Hike```

---

In order to create a new short hike mod:

```dotnet new bepinex5plugin -n ExampleMod -T netstandard2.0 -U 2019.4.29```
